          <p class="lead">Located approximately 15 minutes north of Lloydminster, the camp is situated in a beautiful outdoor setting on the north end of Sandy Beach. Pleasantview Bible Camp is a charitable organization owned by First Baptist Church, Lloydminster. The camp operates in accordance with the statement of faith, principles, and directives of First Baptist Church.</p>
          <p class="lead">The purpose of Pleasantview Bible camp is to serve our community as an extension of First Baptist Church,  providing an environment that meets the physical, mental, social, and spiritual needs of all ages. Our programs are based on Christian principles with the desire that every person find true fulfillment in a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.</p>
          <p class="lead">Because the central focus of our camp is to our youth, we uphold standards that reflect a very positive and wholesome lifestyle for all campers and staff. We encourage the use of the outdoors and wholesome recreational activities to promote this positive lifestyle where foul language is unacceptable and the use or possession of alcohol, tobacco products, or any illegal drugs are prohibited. </p>

        <h1 class="display-4">Our Faith</h1>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <div class="col-12">
          <p class="lead">We believe in the Triune God: There is one God existing eternally in three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</p>
          <p class="lead">We believe that Jesus Christ the Son is true God and true man and is the only way for mankind to be reconciled to God. Without Jesus people are lost in their sin and destined to eternal separation from God.</p>
          <p class="lead">We believe that salvation is a free gift received through faith in Jesus and acceptance of His forgiveness.</p>
          <p class="lead">We believe the Holy Spirit gives the believer the strength and ability to follow God's will in life.</p>
          <p class="lead">We believe that the Bible is God's inspired, inerrant word and constitutes the Divine and only rule of Christian faith and practice.</p>
          <p class="lead">We believe that the church is called to worship and serve God wholeheartedly, sharing His message of love with our world. </p>
